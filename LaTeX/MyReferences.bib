This topic has received a lot of attention more recently in the context of data from non-probability samples such as transaction data, web surveys and social media data. In this paper, I will provide a brief overview of probability sampling methods first and then discuss some recent methods, based on models for the non-probability samples, which could lead to useful inferences from a non-probability sample by itself or when combined with a probability sample. I will also explain how big data may be used as predictors in small area estimation, a topic of current interest because of the growing demand for reliable local area statistics.},

	abstract = {There is a growing interest in National Statistical Offices to produce Official Statistics using non- probability sample data, such as big data or data from a volunteer web survey, either alone or in combination with probability sample data. The main motivation for using non-probability samples is their low cost and respondent burden, and quick turnaround since they allow for producing estimates shortly after the information needs have been identified. However, non-probability samples are not a panacea. They are well known to produce estimates that may be fraught with significant selection bias. We first discuss this important limitation, along with an illustration, and then describe some remedies through inverse probability weighting or mass imputation. We also discuss how to integrate data from probability and non-probability samples through the Fay-Herriot model used in Small Area Estimation. We conclude with a few remarks on some challenges that statisticians are facing when implementing data integration methods.},

Emerging data sources provide new sorts of evidence, provoke new sorts of questions, make possible new sorts of answers and shape the ways that evidence is used to influence policy, public opinion and business practices. Significant developments include open data, big data, data visualisation and the rise of data-driven journalism. These developments are changing the nature of the evidence that is available, the ways in which it is presented and used and the skills needed for its interpretation. Educators should place less emphasis on small samples and linear models and more emphasis on large samples, multivariate description and data visualisation. Techniques used to analyse big data need to be taught. The increasing diversity of data usage requires deeper conceptual analysis in the curriculum; this should include explorations of the functions of modelling, and the politics of data and ethics. The data revolution can invigorate the existing curriculum by exemplifying the perils of biassed sampling, corruption of measures and modelling failures. Students need to learn to think statistically and to develop an aesthetic for data handling and modelling based on solving practical problems.},

The survey designs compared are as identical as possible. Our application area, crime victimization, is demanding in many ways, and not least because of the sensitivity of many of the questions. We first assess the effects that each mode has on frame coverage and on the nonresponse rate. We exploit this analysis in order to develop adjusted sample weights so that we can compare differences in measurement. Second, we hypothesize that the mode that better secures confidentiality will produce higher victimization prevalence. Our results suggest that sensitive questions were particularly difficult in telephone interviews. It seems that the representativeness of survey results depends on several factors-not solely, for instance, on the response rate.},

It presents the results of an empirical study on the level of interest and the academic emotions that were experienced during an engaging lecture course, and how such variables were related to flow experience, self-study time, and study success. The participants (n=107) were Finnish first-year teacher students in an educational psychology lecture course. The data were collected by using a questionnaire that measured interest, academic emotions, sense of competence, challenge experienced, and self-study time five days before the final examination. Correlations among variables were measured, a step-wise cluster analysis and two ANOVA tests conducted. The participants were highly engaged and interested during the course. Interest, enthusiasm, sense of competence, and self-study time correlated positively with the grade awarded for the course. Three clusters (emotional profiles) were identified: [engaged] (36 \%), [unstressed] (25 \%), and [anxious] (39 \%) student groups. [Engaged students] spent the most hours in self-study and received the best grades. [Unstressed students] were the least active in self-study and also achieved the lowest grades. Interest and sense of competence were decisive variables in successful studying during an engaging lecture course. Opportunities to develop blended learning environments that foster active learning in lectures were further discussed. [PUBLICATION ]},

Mixed-mode surveys are faced with a slew of design decisions regarding which types of modes to administer and which sequence to administer them in. Such decisions are largely based on administrative objectives, such as minimizing costs and maximizing response rates. However, just as important to these mixed-mode decisions is their impact on nonresponse bias, measurement error bias, and total bias, which are understudied issues in the mixed-mode literature. In this article, we report on a sequential mixed-mode experiment of young adult drivers randomized to one of two mode sequences: an interviewer-administered (telephone) mode with self-administered (mail) follow-up, or the reverse sequence. Using a mix of direct and indirect bias estimation strategies, we find support for the notion that implementing a second mode of data collection can reduce nonresponse and measurement error bias, but the sequence in which the modes are administered makes a difference: the mail-telephone sequence minimizes bias to a greater extent than the telephone-mail sequence, relative to the starting mode and overall. However, a backfiring effect was found: despite reducing both nonresponse and measurement error bias, switching from mail to telephone increased the total bias in a key estimate of traffic accidents. A discussion of these findings and their implications for survey practice are provided in conclusion.},

However, the utilization of web data raises concerns whether web questionnaires lead to mode-specific measurement bias. We argue that the magnitude of measurement bias strongly depends on the content of a variable. Based on the Luxembourgish Labour Force Survey, we investigate differences between web and telephone data in terms of objective (i.e., Employment Status) and subjective (i.e., Wage Adequacy and Job Satisfaction) variables. To assess whether differences in outcome variables are caused by sample composition or mode-specific measurement bias, we apply a coarsened exact matching that approximates randomized experiments by reducing dissimilarities between web and telephone samples. We select matching variables with a combination of automatic variable selection via random forest and a literature-driven selection. The results show that objective variables are not affected by mode-specific measurement bias, but web participants report lower satisfaction-levels on subjective variables than telephone participants. Extensive supplementary analyses confirm our results. The present study supports the view that the impact of survey mode depends on the content of a survey and its variables.},

Findings - The organization studied is failing to promote equal opportunities policies and to manage the increasingly diverse academic workforce. Behavioural pressures to conform and parochial and inward looking attitudes appear to prevail. Values-in-use and artefacts seem to reflect the assimilation ideals. National origin came out as the key diversity issue. The integration of foreign academics is left to the individuals concerned and little effort is made to accommodate and to take advantage of their unique contribution.

The literature derives from publications from three countries: the UK, the USA and Australia. Surprisingly little systematic research has been conducted on the question of which forms of leadership are associated with departmental effectiveness. The analysis of the studies selected resulted in the identification of 13 forms of leader behaviour that are associated with departmental effectiveness. The findings are considered in relation to the notion of competency frameworks and, in the conclusion, their general implications are explored in relation to the notion of substitutes for leadership.},

	abstract = {Many survey organizations use the response rate as an indicator for the quality of survey data. As a consequence, a variety of measures are implemented to reduce non-response or to maintain response at an acceptable level. However, the response rate is not necessarily a good indicator of non-response bias. A higher response rate does not imply smaller non-response bias. What matters is how the composition of the response differs from the composition of the sample as a whole. This paper describes the concept of R-indicators to assess potential differences between the sample and the response. Such indicators may facilitate analysis of survey response over time, between various fieldwork strategies or data collection modes. Some practical examples are given.},

This multilingual internationalisation is especially noticeable in bilingual universities such as the University of the Basque Country in Spain, where English-medium instruction is becoming more popular. In order to understand higher education multilingual contexts, it is essential to analyse the personal, social, cultural, political and economic struggles that surround the different languages in contact, while becoming critically aware of what this multilingualism implies. Through discussion groups in which different members of the community participated, we researched how the university community deals with the main issues surrounding the university's multilingual policy and practices. We shall address the concerns that different members of the community have expressed in this new context, and the interplay between Basque, a minority language, Spanish, the mainstream language and English. © 2013 © 2013 Society for Research into Higher Education.},

Our previous research showed that graduates varied in how they were able to reflect on their competences at the time of graduation. The present longitudinal mixed-method study follows the same graduates and explores their evaluations of the usefulness of university education and career success, three years after graduation. The follow-up data consisted of 57 graduates' survey answers analysed by quantitative and qualitative methods. The results showed that graduates who were able to describe and evaluate more competences at the time of graduation perceived their current jobs to correspond more to their education. Graduates with more limited evaluations of their competences, on the other hand, had experienced more challenges related to employment and were more uncertain of their goals. The results also showed that having diverse competences and an ability to recognise them at the time of graduation is important for later career success and may also be related to what kind of challenges graduates face in working life.},

Altogether 33 participating university students were interviewed. The data were analysed using qualitative inductive and deductive content analysis. Three student profiles were identified: 1) self-regulated students not using co-regulation, 2) actively co-regulating students with average self-regulation skills, and 3) students with self-regulation problems relying on co-regulation. Self-regulated students not using co-regulation showed evidence of excellent self-regulation skills and deep-level processing, whereas actively co-regulating students with average self-regulation skills showed an active use of co-regulation of learning, some problems in self-regulation, and challenges in deep processing. Students with self-regulation problems relying on co-regulation emphasised other students' support when studying, and exhibited surface-level processing. The results imply that by recognising the profiles of university students it is possible to identify those who may be at risk and in need of more support in their studying.},

	abstract = {This article assesses whether - and to what extent - turnout bias in postelection surveys is reduced by adding a short nonresponse follow-up (NRFU) survey to a mixed-mode survey. Specifically, we examine how the NRFU survey influences response propensities across demographic groups and political factors and whether this affects data quality. We use a rich dataset on validated voter turnout data, collected across two different ballots. In addition to the main survey that comprises computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) and web respondents, both studies include a short follow-up mail survey for nonrespondents. The results demonstrate that collecting extra information from additional respondents on so-called "central" questions is worth the effort. In both studies, the NRFU survey substantially increases representativeness with respect to sociodemographic and participation variables. In particular, voters and politically active citizens are more accurately represented in the NRFU survey. This tends to result in better estimates of turnout determinants in the final (combined) sample than is seen from CATI/web respondents only. Moreover, the increase in response rate and the decrease in nonresponse bias comes at almost no price in terms of measurement errors. Vote overreporting is only slightly higher in the mail follow-up survey than in the main CATI/web survey.},

We aim at developing a multidimensional conceptualization of engagement and utilized network analysis. Data were collected as part of the annual Student Barometer survey in Finland during the 2012-2013 academic year, and we gathered a nationally representative sample ( \&\#61; 2422) of first-year students in different disciplines at 13 Finnish universities. Network analysis confirmed the multidimensional process model of engagement and its six dimensions. The central dimensions of engagement are identity and sense of belonging, which develop in the interplay between individual and collective dimensions as a long-term process. Additional network analyses with covariates identified positive and negative factors that affect engagement. The study adds new perspectives to existing knowledge of engagement. It is important to understand the process-like nature of engagement and make visible factors affecting the process. Based on these findings, we provide novel practical recommendations for interventions for university students who struggle with engagement during their first year.},

Because surveys often are costly instruments, quality-cost trade-offs play a continuing role in the design and analysis of surveys. The advances of telephone, computers, and Internet all had and still have considerable impact on the design of surveys. Recently, a strong focus on methods for survey data collection monitoring and tailoring has emerged as a new paradigm to efficiently reduce non-response error. Paradata and adaptive survey designs are key words in these new developments. Prerequisites to evaluating, comparing, monitoring, and improving quality of survey response are a conceptual framework for representative survey response, indicators to measure deviations thereof, and indicators to identify subpopulations that need increased effort. In this paper, we present an overview of representativeness indicators or R-indicators that are fit for these purposes.

	abstract = {Abstract Representative bureaucracy scholarship has yet to address two interrelated phenomena: intersectionality and changes in relative disadvantage over time. This manuscript addresses these gaps by assessing representation effects at the intersection of race/ethnicity and sex and in previously, but no longer, disadvantaged client groups. It also argues that if bureaucratic representation is viewed as a quest for equity, then representation will decline as disadvantaged client groups approach equity in policy outcomes. Using panel data for US higher education, this study highlights the importance of intersectional representation in bureaucratic organizations. In three of the four race/ethnic/sex combinations, students perform better in the presence of faculty who match them intersectionally (in the fourth case, race but not sex matters). The empirical results also find that as a formerly disadvantaged client group (women) becomes successful within an organization, the active representation relationship declines. These implications inform future representative bureaucracy scholarship examining intersectional groups.},

Recent studies support the notion that academic procrastination can be seen from a situational perspective and as a failure in learning self-regulation. It suggests that interventions should address situational as well as deficits in self-regulation to help students overcome their procrastinating tendencies. The present review examined the recent literature on causes and consequences of academic procrastination and the limited number of studies of academic interventions for academic procrastination. Findings of this review strengthen the need to further study the topic of academic interventions for academic procrastination and to develop effective interventions. At the end of this review, several suggestions for the development of academic interventions are outlined.},

	abstract = {It is often assumed that ranking produces or intensifies competition while the way this happens remains largely obscure. We address this problem by analyzing global university rankings. Drawing on a sociological understanding of competition, we propose a concept of ranking as a type of social operation that combines four sub-operations: comparison of performance, quantification, visualization, and publication of the results. We particularly emphasize visualization and publication to highlight the often-neglected performative dimension of ranking. We then develop an explanation of how ranking builds up competition between universities, highlighting the following three effects of this: (a) globalization of a specific discourse on university excellence; (b) "scarcification" of reputation for excellence; and (c) regular publication of findings, effectively transforming a stable status order into a dynamic, competitive field. In this process, competition for status is being converted from something implicit and inherently local into something explicit and globally acknowledged. We conclude by discussing general conceptual implications of this analysis for the study of the construction and societal impact of competition.},

We compared four different types of interventions: Self-regulation, cognitive behavioral therapy, other therapeutic approaches, and interventions focusing on individuals’ strengths and resources. A large reduction in procrastination after the interventions was found, and the effects remained stable in follow-up assessments. The findings so far suggest that cognitive behavioral therapy reduced procrastination more strongly than the other types of interventions. Other moderator variables, such as the duration of the intervention, had no significant effects. We propose future research that may help to build stronger evidence for the effects of interventions, as well as some guidelines for interventions. •Four different types of interventions were included.•A large reduction in procrastination after the interventions was found.•The effects of the interventions remain stable in follow-up assessments.•Cognitive-behavioral therapy reduced procrastination most.•Other moderators (e.g., duration, sample characteristics) had no effects.},

However, non-probability samples are not a panacea. They are well known to produce estimates that may be fraught with significant selection bias. We first discuss this important limitation, along with an illustration, and then describe some remedies through inverse probability weighting or mass imputation.

	isbn = {978-92-64-36077-8},
	abstract = {Governments are increasingly looking to international comparisons of education opportunities and outcomes as they develop policies to enhance individuals’ social and economic prospects, provide incentives for greater efficiency in schooling, and help to mobilise resources to meet rising demands. The OECD Directorate for Education and Skills contributes to these efforts by developing and analysing the quantitative, internationally comparable indicators that it publishes annually in Education at a Glance. Together with OECD country policy reviews, these indicators can be used to assist governments in building more effective and equitable education systems. Education at a Glance addresses the needs of a range of users, from governments seeking to learn policy lessons to academics requiring data for further analysis to the general public wanting to monitor how their countries’ schools are progressing in producing world-class students. The publication examines the quality of learning outcomes, the policy levers and contextual factors that shape these outcomes, and the broader private and social returns that accrue to investments in education. Education at a Glance is the product of a long-standing, collaborative effort between OECD governments, the experts and institutions working within the framework of the OECD Indicators of Education Systems (INES) programme, and the OECD Secretariat. The publication was prepared by the staff of the Innovation and Measuring Progress Division of the OECD Directorate for Education and Skills, under the responsibility of Dirk Van Damme and Marie-Hélène Doumet, and in co-operation with Étienne Albiser, Andrea Borlizzi, Éric Charbonnier, Manon Costinot, Bruce Golding, Yanjun Guo, Hanna Jang, Corinne Heckmann, Karinne Logez, Camila de Moraes, Simon Normandeau, Gara Rojas González, Daniel Sánchez Serra, Markus Schwabe, Giovanni Maria Semeraro, Choyi Whang and Hajar Sabrina Yassine. Administrative support was provided by Valérie Forges, and additional advice and analytical support were provided by Shinyoung Jeon and Pauline Musset. Cassandra Davis and Sophie Limoges provided valuable support in the editorial and production process. The development of the publication was steered by member countries through the INES Working Party and facilitated by the INES Networks. The members of the various bodies as well as the individual experts who have contributed to this publication and to OECD INES more generally are listed at the end of the book. While much progress has been made in recent years, member countries and the OECD continue to strive to strengthen the link between policy needs and the best available internationally comparable data. This presents various challenges and trade-offs. First, the indicators need to respond to education issues that are high on national policy agendas, and where the international comparative perspective can offer added value to what can be accomplished through national analysis and evaluation. Second, while the indicators should be as comparable as possible, they also need to be as country-specific as is necessary to allow for historical, systemic and cultural differences between countries. Third, the indicators need to be presented in as straightforward a manner as possible, while remaining sufficiently complex to reflect multi-faceted realities. Fourth, there is a general desire to keep the indicator set as small as possible, but it needs to be large enough to be useful to policy makers across countries that face different challenges in education. The OECD will continue not only to address these challenges vigorously and develop indicators in areas where it is feasible and promising to develop data, but also to advance in areas where a considerable investment still needs to be made in conceptual work. The OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and its extension through the OECD Survey of Adult Skills, a product of the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), as well as the OECD Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS), are major efforts to this end.},

Meanwhile, the properties of rankers are rarely, if at all, taken into account. In contrast to the received wisdom, we argue that the institutionalization of rankings in different fields is also contingent upon another, often-neglected factor: Over time, rankers have become increasingly more organized. To investigate the role of ranking organizations, we look into the distinct properties of present-day rankings and highlight three dimensions along which rankings have evolved over the course of the twentieth century, namely, publication frequency, handling complex tasks, and audience engagement. On this basis, we argue that these dimensions have to a large extent been affected by formal organization and we show how ranking organizations have over time developed capacities to: (a) publish rankings on a continual basis; (b) handle the often complex production process by means of division of labor and (c) generate considerable degrees of attention by addressing large and diverse audiences. On a more general note, we argue that accounting for the role of organization in the instutionalization of rankings requires a combination of insights from both “old” and “new” strands of thinking in institutional theory.},

Using qualitative interview data, we applied a theory-driven and person-oriented approach to test the theoretical model of Klingsieck (2013). The sample consisted of 28 Bachelor students whose study pace had been slow during their first university year. Three student profiles emerged. The first concerned strategic delay and was represented by motivated students with strong self-efficacy beliefs who had intentionally postponed their studying. The second consisted of students whose delaying was unnecessary in nature; these students had minor self-regulation problems but were still motivated to study. The third profile consisted of procrastinating students who lacked self-regulation skills and had weaker self-efficacy beliefs. The results indicate that dilatory behaviour can vary from strategic delay to dysfunctional procrastination, and that different factors are related to these various types of dilatory behaviour. This study adds to our theoretical understanding of academic procrastination by empirically testing a new theoretical model of procrastination. In addition, the study shows the value of using a qualitative approach in understanding the phenomenon of dilatory behaviour.},

We argue that increased attention to such procrastination-friendly factors in academic environments is important and that relatively minor measures to reduce their detrimental effects may have substantial benefits for students, institutions, and society.},

However, few studies have provided empirical evidence of the existence of such a link. Instead, quality assurance has created an unfortunate divide between formal rules and routines, and the daily practices in academia associated with teaching and learning. This article reports a study of 'quality work' - concrete practices in academic microcultures with a reputation for being strong in their teaching and learning as well as in their research function. We argue that the relationship between quality assurance and enacted quality practice needs to be understood in the light of how formal organizational structures, as well as cultural characteristics and academic aims, are balanced within working groups in universities.},

Also considered is the significance of these psychological needs and processes within domains such as health care, education, work, sport, religion, and psychotherapy.},

	abstract = {This text on survey sampling contains both basic and advanced material. The main theme is estimation in surveys. . . . This book has four important objectives: 1. To develop the central ideas in survey sampling from the unified perspective of unequal probability sampling. In a majority of surveys, the sampling units have different probabilities of selection, and these probabilities play a crucial role in estimation. 2. To write a basic sampling text that, unlike its predecessors, is guided by statistical modeling in the derivation of estimators. The model assisted approach in this book clarifies and systemizes the use of auxiliary variables, which is an important feature of survey design. 3. To cover significant recent developments in special areas such as analysis of survey data, domain estimation, variance estimation, methods for non-response, and measurement error models. 4. To provide opportunity for students to practice sampling techniques on real data. We provide numerous exercises concerning estimation for real (albeit small) populations described in the appendices.  This book will be useful in teaching basic, as well as more advanced, university courses in survey sampling. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	volume = {1},
	abstract = {, he kirjoittavat. Koulutuksen yleinen trendi näyttää olevan pa-lautteen kerääminen opiskelijoilta. On itsestään sel-vää, että yliopistossa kurssin päättyessä opettaja panee lomakkeet jakoon tai pyytää opiskelijoilta vapaamuotoisia kommentteja opintojaksosta. Mitä hyvää ja mitä huonoa kurssilla oli? Käsittääksemme palautteet muuttavat opetus-ta yllättävän vähän. Kurssin pitäjä lukee palaut-teen läpi, mutta joutuu toteamaan, että sen pohjal-ta muutosten tekeminen opintojaksoon on ongel-mallista. Opiskelijoiden käsitykset ja kokemukset ovat ristiriitaisia keskenään. Sen, minkä yksi opiskelija sanoo avanneen itselleen uusia näkymiä, toinen kokee itsestään selvyydeksi. Se, minkä yksi on kokenut kiinnostavaksi, on ollut toisen mielestä tarpeetonta. Sama pätee myös opetustapoihin. Yksi pitää yhdenlaisesta opiskelusta ja toinen toisen-laisesta. Usein opettajat sopeutuvat valitsevaan järjes-telmään kyseenalaistamatta sen tarkoituksenmu-kaisuutta. Vaikka opettaja näkisikin palautteen ke-räämisen vain muodollisuutena, sen laistaminen herättää syyllisyyden tunteita. Yhteisön sisällä vallitsee näkymätön ja usein julkilausuttukin ole-tus palautteen hyödyllisyydestä. Kun opettaja kerää sen, hän tuntee tehneensä velvollisuuten-sa. Palaute jääkin usein tyhjäksi rituaaliksi (ks. Lappalainen 1997, 196). Globalisoituvilla koulutusmarkkinoilla suoma-laisetkin yliopistot valmistautuvat kiristyvään kilpailutilanteeseen. Yksi osoitus tästä on opetuk-sen ja tutkimuksen laadun varmistamisen menettelytapojen kehittäminen. Ainakin opetuk-sen osalta tälle on tarvetta. Suomalaisessa yliopis-to-opiskelussa on nähdäksemme parantamisen varaa. Opinnoissa on edelleenkin turhan paljon älyllistä tyhjäkäyntiä, sillä opinnoissa voi päästä varsin pitkälle pintasuuntautuneilla opiskelustra-tegioilla. Opetuksen laadun varmistukseen voidaan suh-tautua vakavasti tutkimalla ensin opetuksen ny-kytilaa ja sen jälkeen kehittämällä keinoja havait-tujen puutteiden korjaamiseksi. Esimerkiksi teknillisen korkeakoulun perusopetuksen kehittä-mistyöryhmän loppuraportti (2007) kertoo tällai-sesta opetuksen kehittämisen projektista. Tällai-sissa projekteissa opiskelijapalautteen kerääminen on yksi monista keinoista hankkia tietoa opetuksesta ja opiskelusta sekä niiden rakenteel-lisista ehdoista. Opetuksen määrätietoinen kehit-täminen on kallista, vaivalloista ja pitkäjänteistä puuhaa, mutta pitemmän päälle kumminkin kan-nattavaa. Laadun varmistukseen voidaan suhtautua myös kevyemmin luomalla suhteellisen helposti hallinnoitavia ja yksinkertaisia arviointikäytäntei},

This multilingual internationalisation is especially noticeable in bilingual universities such as the University of the Basque Country in Spain, where English-medium instruction is becoming more popular. In order to understand higher education multilingual contexts, it is essential to analyse the personal, social, cultural, political and economic struggles that surround the different languages in contact, while becoming critically aware of what this multilingualism implies. Through discussion groups in which different members of the community participated, we researched how the university community deals with the main issues surrounding the university's multilingual policy and practices. We shall address the concerns that different members of the community have expressed in this new context, and the interplay between Basque, a minority language, Spanish, the mainstream language and English. © 2013 © 2013 Society for Research into Higher Education.},

Perceived heavy workload is a well-known problem in veterinary studies and is a challenge to the quality of learning. First- and third-year students in both institutions responded to an inventory consisting of items regarding their approaches to learning, self-efficacy, study workload and the teaching-learning environment. There were differences in students' approaches to learning and perceived workload between the two institutions. In both contexts, the strongest predictor of the workload turned out to be the surface approach to learning. Self-efficacy showed a positive correlation with the deep approach to learning and organised studying. The strengths of the teaching-learning environment varied between the institutions. Moreover, the present study discusses how the gained information could be used in improving the teaching-learning environment and students' learning. (HRK / Abstract übernommen).},

	abstract = {On-campus students are requesting online course options, and campuses are increasingly providing online sections of core courses, with a common offering involving online science lectures accompanied by on-campus lab courses. However, low course completion rates by on-campus students in online courses have become an area of concern. This study seeks to identify factors associated with unsuccessful online course completion and withdrawal by investigating course completion rates in an online physics lecture course. The authors use eight years of data (N=3032) to establish lecture course completion patterns then compare these patterns with three semesters (N=940) of a hybrid course combining online lecture with face-to-face laboratories. Deviations from established patterns are identified and student characteristics which are uniquely associated with unsuccessful course completion and withdrawal in online sections are isoloated. Differences in rates of students repeating the class, lower rates of repeating student completion in online sections, and early disengagement by repeating students are found to be important. Results imply the need for early course interventions and/or potential policies regarding repeating students.},

	abstract = {The existing literature suggests that self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies are relevant to student grade performance in both online and blended contexts, although few, if any, studies have compared them. However, due to challenges unique to each group, the variety of SRL strategies that are implicated, and their effect size for predicting performance may differ across contexts. One hundred and forty online students and 466 blended learning students completed the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire. The results show that online students utilised SRL strategies more often than blended learning students, with the exception of peer learning and help seeking. Despite some differences in individual predictive value across enrolment status, the key SRL predictors of academic performance were largely equivalent between online and blended learning students. Findings highlight the relative importance of using time management and elaboration strategies, while avoiding rehearsal strategies, in relation to academic subject grade for both study modes.},
